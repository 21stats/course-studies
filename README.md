storage repo to keep track of my studies

I made this repo to dump all my studies related to watching courses and small stuff.
I have a lot of simple projects in my pc and cloud that I did in the last 2 years of studying and I want to organize all of them in a repo. Also, this will serve to keep track of what I've studied in a particular time of my life.
